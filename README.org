* ArcheOS
This document is intended to help moving first steps in ArcheOS iso building
To obtain help with ArcheOS please refer to wiki and mailing lists.

** Requisites:
All this software must be installed and properly configured

*** live-build 2.x (http://live.debian.net/devel/live-build/)
*** apt-cacher-ng (http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/)

** Other requirements:
*** A working debian (squeeze/wheezy) system to do the build (obviously)
*** Ability to be superuser on the debian machine
*** At least 5GB of free space
*** (optional) a virtualization software such as qemu or virtualbox to test the iso

** Build archeos
   1. Clone the git repository with
      git clone git://github.com/archeos/ArcheOS.git
   2. Enter the ArcheOS directory
   3. Launch the config command
      lb config
   4. If no errors occured during the configuration launch the build command
      sudo lb build
      You have to wait a long time until the build is completed...
   5. At the end of the process, if all is gone fine you should have a 
      binary.iso file in your working directory. Burn it to the cdrom
      or boot up with the virtualization software (see above)
   6. CLEAN THE ENVIRONMENT
      sudo lb clean --purge

Rmemeber to run sudo lb clean --purge BEFORE launch again lb config to reset the 
original status
