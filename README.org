* ArcheOS
This document is intended to help moving first steps in ArcheOS iso building
To obtain help with ArcheOS please refer to wiki and mailing lists.

** Requisites:
All this software must be installed and properly configured

   1. live-build 2.x (http://live.debian.net/devel/live-build/)
   2. apt-cacher-ng (http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~bloch/acng/)

** Other requirements:
   1. A working debian (squeeze/wheezy) system to do the build (obviously)
   2. Ability to be superuser on the debian machine (eg. to use sudo)
   3. At least 5GB of free space
   4. (optional) a virtualization software such as qemu or virtualbox to test the iso

** Build archeos
   1. Clone the git repository with
      git clone git://github.com/archeos/ArcheOS.git
   2. Enter the ArcheOS/debian-live directory
      cd ArcheOS/debian-live/
   3. Launch the config command
      sudo lb clean && lb config
   4. If no errors occured during the configuration launch the build command
      sudo lb build
      You have to wait a long time until the build is completed...
   5. At the end of the process, if all is gone fine you should have a 
      binary.iso file in your working directory. Burn it to the cdrom
      or boot up with the virtualization software (see above)
   6. CLEAN THE ENVIRONMENT
      sudo lb clean --purge

Rmemeber to run sudo lb clean --purge BEFORE launch again lb config to reset the 
original status
